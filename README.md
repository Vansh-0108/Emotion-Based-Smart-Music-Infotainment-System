# Emotion-Based Smart Music Infotainment System

## Overview

This project introduces an innovative Emotion-Based Smart Music Infotainment System tailored for integration into AUTOSAR-compliant automotive platforms. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system captures and analyzes real-time facial expressions to accurately determine the driver's mood. Embedded within the AUTOSAR architecture, the system seamlessly communicates with an emotion analysis module, ensuring efficient integration. By continuously monitoring the driver's emotions, the system dynamically interfaces with the Spotify API, fetching curated playlists or suggesting music tracks that align with the detected mood.

This integration not only optimizes the in-car entertainment experience by personalizing the music selection but also enhances safety by minimizing distractions associated with manual playlist curation. The project showcases the potential of combining emotion recognition technology, machine learning, and API integration within the context of AUTOSAR, presenting a novel and intelligent approach to in-car entertainment systems. The emphasis on real-time interaction with external services ensures a user-friendly and engaging driving experience, aligning with the evolving landscape of smart automotive technologies.
